# cas-cohort-cup

Cohort Cup is a competition in NYU's College of Science between its 44 first-year student cohorts. It engages 1500 students through Facebook Challenges and Marquee Events, both of which earn students points. I created this program to make tracking the scores as streamlined as possible. I'm currently working on expanding this simple Python program into an Express application.
